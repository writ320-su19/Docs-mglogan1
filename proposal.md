## Project Description
For our semester long Technical Report project, I have decided to do a documentation project on different medical device companies. I am wanting to dip my toes in the water in this field after I finish my summer classes. I feel like by doing this project it will be helping with my job hunting as well as further my knowledge in technical writing. I plan on making infographics for each company or device. These infographics will include information on different things such as average yearly income for salesmen and women, reviews on devices, reviews on employees' experiences at the company, and other factors that would play into determining which company would be best to work for, for my audience. My project will be focused on an audience that is interested in entering the medical device sales field, looking for entry-level positions in different companies around the United States. My project is focused on a very broad audience with no age-range or specific group.
  
Aside from collecting and organizing the information onto infographics, I feel as though making an excel sheet with the information on it will help me as well. Excel is an easy way to gather the information and organize it in one place, rather than the information being spread on different pages of infographics. I feel like this will be a time-consuming project that requires a lot of research on my part. I will most likely gather the information and select the companies from the job ads that I see on LinkedIn. Because this is such a popular job posting site, I feel as though it will be the best place to start my research. For the length of the project, I plan to have ten to twenty columns of information on each company that I choose. Because of this, it will be a pretty extensive research commitment and project.

I have the GDA table formatted from the website you directed us to in the weekly announcements. I will attach the formatting of this graph as well, but I wanted you to see it in the way it would post.
